## Agora
Want to find farmers' markets near you? So did I! I created this project at Fullstack Academy in our 4-day hackathon. I spent way longer than anticipated trying to get the US Department of Agriculture API to work. This was a great lesson in how to deal with querying external APIs, and in how to write reallly complicated axios requests.

It's scrappy, it's buggy, and the code might be made of spaghetti. But I wrote it, and I'm sharing it with the world.


## Start

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.
